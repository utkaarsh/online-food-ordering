to create a new byDefault branch: git branch -M main

package.json is for configuring npm

package-lock.json keeps the exact log of the inital viersion of all the package versions installed

A dependency that  has its own dependancies is called tranisitive dependencies

In maps and loop you should always have a key ,why ? it helps the loop to uniquely identify each element or else it can fail to identify and the same loop gets repeated all the time or ELSE you can you use index, BUT React officialy doest not support or recommend this as it is a bad practice, it could change the order of your elements...if thers's like no unique id...then lastly use index


DATA STRUCTURES USED FOR REACT:
RECONCILLIATION (GIT of DOMS basically) :

Diff Aligorthm is used in manipulation of virtual DOM, it is used to find out the difference between the updated virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM,it will first calculate the difference and then simultaneously update it 
all of this happens at the same time thats why the states in react gets updated so fast
This is also called as REACT FIBRE, this was introduced in react 16,this is the new way of what we discussed earlier
React fibre is the on going implementation of react's core algorithm 
Its key feature is incremental rendering, incremental rendering: the ability to split the rendering work into chunks and spread it over multiple frame 
super variable concept (eg const [var,setVar=useState]) is nothing but actually destructuring of array.

 Monolith Architecture  vs  Microservice Architecture

Monolith - [API, UI, Auth, DB, SMS] 
Microservice - [API] [Auth] [DB] [SMS] It has single responsibility concerns, also know as (aka) single princile concerns

React has one of the bestest and fastest rendering methods thats why you never have to bother about rendering in react
 useEffect-
 the useEffect gets called after the rendering of the page
 also note that if there is no dependency array (i.e the array after the callback arrow function) then useEffect is called on every render   
 and if the useEffect contains an empty dependency array[] then it is called only on the initial render just once
 
fetch() is super magic provided by browser engine to javascript to fetch data from API

SHIMMER UI is the latest practice used in indrustries instead of loading a spiiner-loader

useState()-
Used to create local state variables inside a functional component
Whenever state variables are updated,react recreates a reconsiliation cycle or renders

ROUTES 
-RouterProvider: this will provide actual routing configuration to our app
 useRouteError() - Hook
 it gives you information about your error 

REACT LIFECYCLE
INITIAL PHASE
    -showing in UI
    - DEfault Data

 Mounting Phase in react :
    - Parent constructor
    - Parent render

        First constructor
        First render
        -HTML default data
    - First componentDidMount
    - Second componentDidMount


UPDATING Phase in react :
    render (api data)
    <HTML (new API data)>
    componentDidUpdate

Unmounting Phase
    -removing from UI
    -componentWillUnmount
    -usually happens when you change the component or move to a new page     

\\CV
    - used the latest version of react routes to follow the practice of using latest trends and also understand and improvise the judgement of what is better and what is not 
    -learned tu use Reacts Custom hooks for efficient and clean coding
    -learned about an important concept of dynamic bundling

What is higher order component?
Higher order component is function that takes a component(as an input ) and return a component(which is much more enhanced ..like adding some features to it)
